//! DWG through BlackCAD's open DWG and DXF crates (`cad-dwg`, `cad-dxf`, MIT OR Apache-2.0,
//! <https://github.com/withshalom/CAD>): the engine this crate tries first. They read DWG from R13
//! to 2018 and later except 2007 (AC1021), write AutoCAD 2018 (AC1032) DWG, and count what a
//! conversion leaves out. They use the standard library alone, so they also run in the web build.
//!
//! A conversion here is [`Outcome::Whole`] only when nothing was left out and nothing failed to
//! decode; anything else is [`Outcome::Partial`], with a note for each loss, and the caller tries
//! acadrust before settling for it.
